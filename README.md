Introduction

Internet of Things and Interactive Devices is the field of technology that deals with physical objects with computational capabilties, sensors and actuators that can connect to any form of network, including the internet, to exchange data with other devices, servers or the cloud.

This project aims to make use of this concept to build a GPS tracker based system for running enthusiasts to track their runs and workouts. A runner will be able to take the device with them while on a run. During this time, the Raspberry Pi will stream the GPS data as well as time data to a remote server via WiFi or Cellular. The server will then store this data and allow the user to view it on a web interface. The user will be able to view the route they took on a map, as well as the time it took them to complete the run. The user will also be able to view their average speed, distance, and other statistics. The user will also be able to view their previous runs and compare them to each other.

The aim of this assignment is to:

1. Build and connect the hardware components
2. Receive and process GPS data from the GPS module
3. Send GPS data to a remote server
4. Serve the data on a web dashboard
